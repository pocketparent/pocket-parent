## Technical Improvements

### Backend Enhancements
- Structured the backend with proper service separation (OpenAI, SMS, Parser)
- Enhanced the data manager for better data handling and subscription support
- Added comprehensive API endpoints for all required functionality
- Ensured proper environment variable handling for secure deployment
- Created a test script for verifying API functionality

### Frontend Enhancements
- Implemented a responsive layout with mobile support
- Added real-time data synchronization
- Created reusable components for consistent UI
- Integrated subscription status checks throughout the UI
- Improved navigation with a sidebar menu

### Deployment Readiness
- Configured the backend to run on port 8000
- Removed local-only code and hardcoded values
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Added environment variable examples for both frontend and backend
- Prepared the application for deployment to services like Render or Railway

## File Structure
The application maintains a clean separation between frontend and backend:

```

## Next Steps
While all required features have been implemented, here are some potential future enhancements:

1. Implement proper authentication and user management
2. Migrate from JSON storage to a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB
3. Add more advanced analytics for baby routines
4. Implement push notifications instead of polling
5. Add more sophisticated AI features like routine suggestions

## Conclusion
The Hatchling application is now a production-ready solution with all the requested features implemented. The codebase is structured for scalability and maintainability, with proper separation of concerns and clean integration between components.
